## What you can expect
I mainly code whatever I feel like is. Right now, that is mods for Minecraft. Hoping to branch out once I have more experience and knowledge

Some notes:
- I'm pretty much a novice when it comes to programming, so my code is probably bad. Trying to improve, though...
- I code as a hobby and will probably abandon projects I don't care about anymore or don't have the motivation to keep updating
- Projects marked as no updates planned are on the backburner and probably won't get any updates until I feel motivated to update them
- Something something final thoughts

Thanks, and have fun...
