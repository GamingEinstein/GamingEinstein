## Public projects

## What you can expect
I mainly code whatever I feel like is. Right now, that is mods for Minecraft<br>
Some notes:
- I'm a novice at programming in general, so my code is probably bad. Don't worry about it lmao
- I code as a hobby and will probably abandon projects I don't care about anymore
- Projects marked as no updates planned are on the backburner and probably won't get any updates until I feel motivated to update them
- Something something final thoughts
<br>
Thanks, and have fun
